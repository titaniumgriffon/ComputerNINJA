# ComputerNINJA

This was was born because although I did like the other Powershell Tools I didn't like the fact that the code was not open where it could be read and scrutinized. So I decided to build my own tool that can be used by anyone that has admin credentials. 

The basic idea of this tool was to have something that I can use or give to the help desk to pull computer information directly from the machine for troubleshooting, and things from Active Directory such as the Bitlocker Key and the LAPS Admin password.
